\subsection{Technical Indicators}
What are technical indicators
% Technical indicators are the rule of thumb or pattern-based signals produced mathematically by the stock price or volume. The fundatioin of technical indicators is the historical price of the stocks. It is belived that the history will repeated itself as the time extends. In other words, patterns of the market behavior . By analyzing the historical data, technical analysis use indicators to determine market entry and exit points.

RSI formula

% Relative Strength Index (RSI) was developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. [3] in 1978. This index is a widely used technical indicator of the financial market for measuring the magnitude of recent price changes. RSI regards a rising stock price as strength from buyers, a falling price as strength from sellers, and the closing price is the outcome of the relative strength of buyers and sellers. Here are the formulae for calculating RSI. The calculating process can be divided into two steps. For step one (as shown in formulae \ref{step_1}), the average gain and loss is the average of rice and drop respectively during the look-back period. As for step two, with the RSI in step one, we can recursively calculate the next RSI using formula 2, where $N$ is a parameter, representing a look-back period. The formulae for calculating RSI are as follows.

% \begin{equation}\label{step_1}\scalebox{1}
%     {$RSI_{step\ one}=100-\left[\dfrac{100}{1+\dfrac{Average\ gain}{Average\ loss}}\right]$}
%     \vspace{1em}
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}\label{step_2}\scalebox{1}
%     {$RSI_{step\ two}=100-\left[\dfrac{100}{1+\dfrac{Previous\ Average\ Gain\times(N-1)+Current\ Gain}{-(Previous\ Average\ Loss)\times(N-1)+Current\ Loss}}\right]$}
%     \vspace{1em}
